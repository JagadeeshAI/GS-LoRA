{"text": "usually , he would be tearing around the living room , playing with his toys ."}
{"text": "but just one look at a minion sent him practically catatonic ."}
{"text": "that had been megan 's plan when she got him dressed earlier ."}
{"text": "he 'd seen the movie almost by mistake , considering he was a little young for the pg cartoon , but with older cousins , along with her brothers , mason was often exposed to things that were older ."}
{"text": "she liked to think being surrounded by adults and older kids was one reason why he was a such a good talker for his age ."}
{"text": "`` are n't you being a good boy ? ''"}
{"text": "instead , his baby blues remained focused on the television ."}
{"text": "since the movie was almost over , megan knew she better slip into the bedroom and finish getting ready ."}
{"text": "each time she looked into mason 's face , she was grateful that he looked nothing like his father ."}
{"text": "it was only his build that he was taking after his father ."}
{"text": "where megan was a diminutive 5'3 '' , davis was 6'1 '' and two hundred pounds ."}
{"text": "mason was already registering off the charts in height and weight according to his pediatrician ."}
{"text": "davis had seen mason only twice in his lifetime-the day he had been born and the day he came home from the hospital ."}
{"text": "after that , he had n't been interested in any of the pictures and emails megan sent ."}
{"text": "with his professional football career on the rise , davis had n't wanted to be shackled with the responsibilities of a baby ."}
{"text": "instead , he wanted to spend his time off the field partying until all hours of the night ."}
{"text": "he only paid child support when megan threatened to have his wages garnished ."}
{"text": "she dreaded the day when mason was old enough to ask about his father ."}
{"text": "she never wanted anything in the world to hurt him , and she knew that being rejected by his father would ."}
{"text": "with a sigh , she stepped into the dress and slid it over her hips ."}
{"text": "wrestling around to get the zipper all the way up caused her to huff and puff ."}
{"text": "standing back from the mirror , she turned to and fro to take in her appearance ."}
{"text": "she 'd always loved how the dress made her feel sexy , but at the same time was very respectable ."}
{"text": "while it boasted a sweetheart neckline , the hemline fell just below her knees ."}
{"text": "she put on her pearls-a high school graduation gift from her uncle aidan , or `` ankle '' , as she often called him ."}
{"text": "aidan was her mother 's baby brother and only son of the family ."}
{"text": "when she was born , he was only eight and a half ."}
{"text": "as the first grandchild , megan spent a lot of time with her grandparents , and that in turn , meant she spent a lot of time with aidan ."}
{"text": "he had devoted hours to holding her and spoiling her rotten ."}
{"text": "when it came time for her to talk , she just could n't seem to get `` uncle aidan '' out ."}
{"text": "instead , she called him `` ankle . ''"}
{"text": "it was a nickname that had stuck with him even now that he was thirty-four and married ."}
{"text": "while it had been no question that she wanted him as godfather for mason , she had been extremely honored when he and his wife , emma , had asked her to be their son , noah 's , godmother ."}
{"text": "she loved her newest cousin very much and planned to be the best godmother she could for him ."}
{"text": "as she stepped out of the bedroom , she found that mason had yet to move ."}
{"text": "`` okay buddy , time to go . ''"}
{"text": "when he started to whine , she shook her head ."}
{"text": "`` we have such a fun day ahead of us ."}
{"text": "it 's noah 's baptism , and then there 's a party at uncle aidan and aunt emma 's house . ''"}
{"text": "`` yes , you 'll get to see and play with beau , too . ''"}
{"text": "one day when they had their own place again , she would get him a dog ."}
{"text": "he loved them too much to be denied ."}
{"text": "`` oomph , '' she muttered , as they started up the basement stairs ."}
{"text": "`` yes , you 're getting to be such a big , heavy boy . ''"}
{"text": "when they made it to the kitchen , megan paused to catch her breath ."}
{"text": "she only had a second before her mother breezed in with sean , and her youngest brother , gavin ."}
{"text": "feeling like she was once again a teenager , she filed behind her parents as they headed into the garage ."}
{"text": "`` i want to drive , '' gavin said ."}
{"text": "with a smirk , sean replied , `` like i 'm gon na let you drive my car . ''"}
{"text": "he then slid into the driver 's seat as gavin reluctantly walked around to the passenger 's side ."}
{"text": "`` we 'll see you there in just a few , '' her mother called ."}
{"text": "sean acknowledged her with a two finger salute before cranking up and pulling down the driveway ."}
{"text": "megan worked to get mason into the car seat in her parents ' land rover ."}
{"text": "once he was safely strapped and buckled in , she hopped in beside him ."}
{"text": "her parents rattled along to each other as they made their way through the tree-lined suburbs where megan had grown up ."}
{"text": "while some might look on her as having a mark against her character being an unwed mother , she had lived a relatively non-rebellious life ."}
{"text": "even though she 'd been a cheerleader and ran with the popular crowd in school , she rarely partied to excess ."}
{"text": "instead , she had focused on getting good grades ."}
{"text": "at that time , she had her heart set on going to medical school and becoming a doctor ."}
{"text": "from the time she was a little girl , she had wanted nothing more than to help people ."}
{"text": "she was always mending birds with broken wings or trying to resuscitate squirrels who had been hit by cars ."}
{"text": "she ditched playing princess for playing `` hospital . ''"}
{"text": "her desire to become a doctor was why she needed the best scores and best activities and why she generally shunned any temptations to lead her off the right path ."}
{"text": "she had even managed to bypass the usual freshman craziness when she went off to the university of georgia ."}
{"text": "it was n't until she fell in love for the first time in her life that she threw everything away ."}
{"text": "sadly , she could n't say that her first love was davis , mason 's father ."}
{"text": "instead , it was another football player , this time a running back at uga , who captured and later broke her heart a year later ."}
{"text": "carsyn ran with the fast crowd , and when she was with him , she partied and drank too much ."}
{"text": "he was controlling and possessive , and he wanted all of her time ."}
{"text": "when she was with him , she had little time for studying ."}
{"text": "with her grades already in the toilet , she was unprepared for the emotional breakdown she experienced when carsyn broke up with her ."}
{"text": "devastated , she stopped going to class and ended up flunking the semester ."}
{"text": "by the time she got back on track with her grades , she had abandoned any hope of medical school ."}
{"text": "instead , she decided that she would become a nurse , which would fulfill her need to care for sick people ."}
{"text": "of course , her relationship with davis ended up derailing shortly before graduation when she got pregnant unexpectedly ."}
{"text": "she had to take several semesters off after mason was born ."}
{"text": "she was a few years off from when she had originally planned on graduating , but she was excited after everything had that had happened , she was finally finishing ."}
{"text": "her mother 's voice brought megan out of her thoughts ."}
{"text": "`` here we are , '' she said pleasantly ."}
{"text": "leaning forward in her seat , megan eyed the clock on the dashboard ."}
{"text": "she was n't surprised to see they had arrived half an hour before the baptism started ."}
{"text": "one thing her mother prided herself on was being on time and lending a hand ."}
{"text": "as they started into the church , her mother reached for mason ."}
{"text": "`` we 'll take him so you can go see if emma needs any help . ''"}
{"text": "megan bent over to kiss mason 's cheek ."}
{"text": "`` see you in a little while , sweetie . ''"}
{"text": "he grinned and then happily dodged her mother 's arms for her father 's instead , which made megan smile ."}
{"text": "he was such a man 's man already ."}
{"text": "he loved sitting between her brothers on the couch and watching tv ."}
{"text": "while it was good that he had so many male role models , she only hoped he had n't inherited too much of his father 's personality ."}
{"text": "after megan watched them disappear in the crowd of family and friends waiting in the church alcove , she bypassed everyone by turning right and heading down the hallway ."}
{"text": "at the last door on the right , she knocked ."}
{"text": "`` it 's me , megan . ''"}
{"text": "emma 's best friend , casey , answered the door ."}
{"text": "`` well , if it is n't the fairy godmother , '' she mused with a grin ."}
{"text": "after megan stepped inside , casey threw her arms around her ."}
{"text": "megan had only met her a few times , but it was hard not liking emma 's vivacious and outgoing friend ."}
{"text": "`` so how 's it going ? ''"}
{"text": "megan asked , gazing from noah 's diapered but na**d form to emma ."}
{"text": "she was feeding him a bottle while her upper body was draped in a towel ."}
{"text": "as noah sucked on his bottle , he twirled a strand of emma 's auburn hair between his fingers ."}
{"text": "both father and son were fans of emma wearing her hair down ."}
{"text": "`` good , i guess ."}
{"text": "i mean , i do n't have a lot of experience with baptisms . ''"}
{"text": "megan laughed and motioned to the towel and noah ."}
{"text": "`` it looks like you 're taking all the proper precautions-nothing like spit-up on your dress or his . ''"}
{"text": "with a nod , emma replied , `` tell me about it ."}
{"text": "especially since his gown is so old . ''"}
{"text": "megan eyed the lacy baptismal gown hanging on the closet door ."}
{"text": "she recognized it from pictures of ankle 's baptism ."}
{"text": "he had worn it , and now it was being passed down to his son ."}
{"text": "`` i 'm sure aidan would n't appreciate you alluding to the fact his gown is an antique , thus in turn saying he 's old . ''"}
{"text": "`` no , i 'm sure he would n't ."}
{"text": "of course , he 'd probably argue that while the gown might not have held up , he still looks fabulous and much younger than his age . ''"}
{"text": "`` that sounds just like him . ''"}
{"text": "she bent over emma to rub one of noah 's hands ."}
{"text": "he grabbed her thumb in his fist and held on for dear life ."}
{"text": "`` aw , you love your godmother , do n't you noah ? ''"}
{"text": "noah momentarily stopped sucking on the bottle to flash a quick smile , which warmed megan 's heart ."}
{"text": "`` he 's such a sweet boy , '' she mused ."}
{"text": "`` and a charmer , just like his old man , '' casey mused ."}
{"text": "`` that too , '' megan agreed ."}
{"text": "thinking about her position , she cocked her head at casey ."}
{"text": "`` are you sure you 're fine with me being the godmother ? ''"}
{"text": "casey waved her hand dismissively ."}
{"text": "`` honey , the last thing i need is the responsibility ."}
{"text": "i plan on spoiling noah rotten and corrupting him as only a good auntie can do ! ''"}
{"text": "`` i 'm very satisfied with both my choices , megan ."}
{"text": "you do n't have to worry . ''"}
{"text": "`` so who is the godfather again ?"}
{"text": "i know he 's not part of the family . ''"}
{"text": "casey gasped as her hand flew to her chest dramatically ."}
{"text": "`` you mean , you 've never met dr. mcdreamy bollywood ? ''"}
{"text": "`` no , i have n't ."}
{"text": "i mean , i 've heard about him and how he flew aidan home in time for noah 's birth . ''"}
{"text": "she noticed the pleading look that emma exchanged with casey ."}
{"text": "what should i know about him ? ''"}
{"text": "casey tapped her chin with her index finger ."}
{"text": "`` hmm , what should you know about the good godfather ? ''"}
{"text": "`` first off , he is seriously delectable ."}
{"text": "i mean , the man is like sex on a stick ."}
{"text": "megan suddenly felt her interest piquing ."}
{"text": "she had n't imagined that the godfather would be good-looking ."}
{"text": "it had been such a long time since she had dated anyone ."}
{"text": "scratch that-it had been a long time since she 'd had sex with anyone ."}
{"text": "she 'd spent the last two years completely dateless since she and davis broke up ."}
{"text": "she could practically join one of the local parishes as a nun with how long she had abstained ."}
{"text": "he reminds me of that bollywood actor john abraham , '' casey said ."}
{"text": "`` since when do you watch bollywood movies ? ''"}
{"text": "`` since one of nate 's friends asked us to an indian film festival . ''"}
{"text": "`` besides the fact that he 's a serious looker , he 's also kind , compassionate , and caring-an overall wonderful man . ''"}
{"text": "`` and he 's loaded because he 's a doctor . ''"}
{"text": "this man was sounding better and better by the minute ."}
{"text": "`` is he single ? ''"}
{"text": "emma made a strangled noise before casey replied , ``"}
{"text": "he 's a widower actually . ''"}
{"text": "megan pursed her lips at the prospect ."}
{"text": "widowers usually fell into two categories-those who were still devastated by their wives ' deaths or those who were ready to have fun and live a little ."}
{"text": "she certainly hoped this pesh guy fell into the second category ."}
{"text": "more than anything , she wanted to have a little fun herself ."}
{"text": "`` do you really think you might be interested in dating pesh ? ''"}
{"text": "emma asked , as she moved noah to her shoulder to burp him ."}
{"text": "with a shrug , megan replied , `` dating him or just having some fun with him ."}
{"text": "sounds like he could use some . ''"}
{"text": "emma grimaced as she wiped noah 's face off ."}
{"text": "`` this is exactly why i told aidan not to try and fix you two up . ''"}
{"text": "`` what do you mean ? ''"}
{"text": "`` pesh needs a relationship , not a hook-up after all he 's been through ."}
{"text": "besides his wife 's death , he has n't had it easy on the dating front . ''"}
{"text": "when casey snorted , emma shot her a death glare ."}
{"text": "it 's just he does n't need to get involved with someone who is n't interested in a long-term relationship . ''"}
{"text": "`` em , you might as well tell her , '' casey urged ."}
{"text": "megan glanced between the two of them ."}
{"text": "`` tell me what ? ''"}
{"text": "`` fine , '' emma huffed resignedly ."}
{"text": "she handed noah to casey ."}
{"text": "`` make yourself useful by changing his diaper . ''"}
{"text": "as casey got busy cleaning up noah , emma turned to megan ."}
{"text": "`` when aidan and i broke up- ''"}
{"text": "`` what you meant to say is , after you left aidan when he did n't show up for noah 's gender ultrasound because he was cheating on you ? ''"}
{"text": "casey interrupted , waving around the wet wipe in her hand ."}
{"text": "emma closed her eyes for a moment before shaking her head ."}
{"text": "`` yes , that 's right ."}
{"text": "thank you so very much for bringing up that aspect of our break-up on today of all days . ''"}
{"text": "casey gripped noah 's ankles and hoisted up his little butt to slide on the new diaper ."}
{"text": "`` you 're welcome . ''"}
{"text": "`` anyway , as you were saying , '' megan pressed ."}
{"text": "so it was when aidan and i were broken up that i met pesh ."}
{"text": "i was with your papa fitzgerald the day of his heart attack at the vfw , and pesh was the doctor who treated him . ''"}
{"text": "`` so ... you both struck up a friendship then ? ''"}
{"text": "you see , patrick wanted to force aidan to really fight for me , and he felt the best way to do it would be for him to have some competition . ''"}
{"text": "megan felt her eyes widening in surprise ."}
{"text": "`` papa wanted pesh to date you ? ''"}
{"text": "emma was momentarily distracted by casey blowing raspberries on noah 's stomach ."}
{"text": "a smile spread across her face as noah kicked his legs and giggled at casey ."}
{"text": "`` want me to get him in his dress ? ''"}
{"text": "casey asked , as she glanced up ."}
{"text": "`` if you do n't mind . ''"}
